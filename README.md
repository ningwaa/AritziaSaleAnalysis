Aritzia Sale Analysis:

Project Motivation:
This dashboard was created as a passion project driven by my interest in fashion and data storytelling. 
As someone who closely follows trends and seasonal sales, I was inspired to build this dashboard during an Aritzia sale event. With so many options available, I wanted to analyze which products were not only popular, but also worth the price, corporate-ready, and highly recommended by customers.
By combining my love for fashion with data analysis, I aimed to create a guide that helps shoppers make smarter, more informed decisions—especially during high-demand sale seasons.
